Personal info

I'll speak about my PhD topic
which sits somewhere between
software engineering,
information science, and
scholarly communications, or scientometrics.

I AIM TO DEVISE A METRIC THAT REPRESENTS THE
IMPACT OF DEPENDENCIES IN RESEARCH SOFTWARE,
IN ORDER TO DEFINE CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOFTWARE 
FOR CITATION PURPOSES
 
Because it is still early days
what I'll present here
is mainly the theoretical backdrop for my PhD
and an outlook on my work plan.

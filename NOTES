Personal info

I'll speak about my PhD topic
which sits somewhere between
software engineering,
information science, and
scholarly communications, or scientometrics.
 
Because it is still early days
what I'll present here
is mainly the theoretical backdrop for my PhD
and an outlook on my work plan.
